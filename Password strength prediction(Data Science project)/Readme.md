### Password Strength Prediction Using NLP
This repository contains a Python project that predicts the strength of passwords. The project uses a variety of factors to assess password strength, including length, complexity, and common patterns. The project can be used to help users create stronger passwords, or to assess the security of existing passwords.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the password_strength_predictor.py file in a Python IDE. The password_strength_predictor.py file contains all of the code that you need to run the project.

### Usage
To use the password strength predictor, you will need to provide a password as input. The password can be provided as a string. The project will then output a score that indicates the strength of the password. The score is a number between 0 and 2, where 2 indicates a very strong password.

### Factors Considered
The password strength predictor considers a variety of factors when assessing password strength. These factors include:

Length: Longer passwords are generally stronger than shorter passwords.</br>
Complexity: Passwords that contain a variety of different characters, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, are generally stronger than passwords that only contain a few types of characters.</br>
Common patterns: Passwords that contain common patterns, such as "123456" or "password", are generally weaker than passwords that do not contain common patterns.</br>
