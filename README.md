Introduction
This repository contains a collection of data science projects that I have worked on. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including machine learning, natural language processing, and data visualization. I hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in learning more about data science.

Projects
The following is a list of the projects that are included in this repository:

Movie Recommendation Engine: This project uses machine learning to recommend movies to users. The model is trained on a dataset of movie ratings and reviews.
Customer Churn Prediction: This project uses machine learning to predict which customers are likely to churn. The model is trained on a dataset of customer data, including demographics, purchase history, and contact information.
Text Classification: This project uses machine learning to classify text into different categories. The model is trained on a dataset of text documents, each of which has been labeled with a category.
Sentiment Analysis: This project uses natural language processing to analyze the sentiment of text. The model is trained on a dataset of text documents, each of which has been labeled with a sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
Data Visualization: This project uses data visualization techniques to explore and communicate the results of data analysis. The project includes a variety of visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots.
Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you will need to clone it to your local machine. Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the Jupyter notebooks in a web browser. The Jupyter notebooks contain all of the code and data that you need to run the projects.

Contributing
